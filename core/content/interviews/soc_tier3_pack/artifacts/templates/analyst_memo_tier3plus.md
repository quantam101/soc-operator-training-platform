## Evaluation Notes (Instructor Use Only)

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Tradeoff stated before irreversible action
- [ ] Pause designed and executed
- [ ] Authority distributed (R/A/C/I defined)
- [ ] Trust repair plan explicit
- [ ] Operator bias named + micro-rule enforceable

**This is non-scoring. Good judgment is pattern, not points.**
