# Tier-3+ Evaluation Philosophy (Non-Scoring)

Tier-3+ is about **judgment under ambiguity**, not points.

## What Tier-3+ Evaluates

### 1. Tradeoff Clarity
- Can you name what you're sacrificing and why?
- "We are trading **speed** for **certainty**"
- Who must explicitly accept the residual risk?

### 2. Authority Handling
- Does authority compress to you under pressure (single decision maker)?
- Or do you distribute it (R/A/C/I framework)?
- Who can call a safety pause?

### 3. Pause Opportunity Design
- Where should you have slowed down?
- What signal justified a 5-minute pause?
- What mechanism forces the pause next time?

### 4. Trust Repair Planning
- Who lost trust if you fail? (Team, exec, customer, auditor)
- What's the social repair cost?
- What protocol prevents repeat trust breaks?

### 5. Evidence Discipline
- Known facts vs unknowns vs assumptions
- What's your evidence bar before irreversible action?
- What's the fastest high-value evidence to collect?

### 6. Business Framing
- Mission impact + profitability + risk exposure
- Not just "technical correctness"
- How do you explain tradeoffs to non-technical execs?

## What Tier-3+ Does NOT Do

- ❌ No numeric scores
- ❌ No grades (A/B/C/D/F)
- ❌ No leaderboard or ranking
- ❌ No opaque ML model dependency
- ❌ No "right answer" key

## Pass Condition

A "good" Tier-3+ memo contains:

- ✅ **Tradeoff stated** before irreversible action
- ✅ **Missed signal captured** (or sensing gap identified)
- ✅ **Authority distributed** (R/A/C/I defined)
- ✅ **Trust repair plan** explicit and credible
- ✅ **Operator bias named** + micro-rule enforceable

## Why Non-Scoring?

**Judgment quality is pattern, not points.**

- A single session doesn't measure judgment
- Pattern emerges over 12 weeks (one quarter)
- Repeated misses → doctrine promotion → gate
- Gates accumulate into operator-specific checklist

## Instructor Role

Instructor reads memos for:
- Pattern detection (repeated misses)
- Bias identification (momentum, confirmation, authority compression)
- Doctrine promotion opportunities (turn miss into gate)

Instructor does NOT:
- Assign numeric scores
- Compare operators on leaderboard
- Grade on "correctness"

## Operator Role

Operator uses Tier-3+ for:
- Self-awareness (what's my default under pressure?)
- Micro-rule building (enforceable next-time actions)
- Gate accumulation (personal checklist grows over time)

Operator does NOT:
- Optimize for score
- Game the system
- Hide misses

## Failure Modes This Philosophy Prevents

### 1. Score Optimization
- Operators game numeric rubrics
- Focus shifts from learning to score maximization
- Misses get hidden instead of surfaced

### 2. Comparison Toxicity
- Leaderboards create social pressure
- Operators hide uncertainty to "look good"
- Trust collapses in cohort

### 3. False Precision
- Single numeric score implies false certainty
- Judgment is multi-dimensional (no single number)
- Pattern emerges over time, not in one session

### 4. External Validation Dependency
- Operators wait for instructor "grade"
- Self-awareness atrophies
- Micro-rules never form

## What Good Looks Like

**Quarter 1:**
- Operator completes 12 weekly sessions
- Identifies 3 repeated misses
- Promotes 1 doctrine gate

**Quarter 2:**
- Gate enforced (pause mechanism works)
- New patterns emerge
- Doctrine accumulates

**Quarter 4:**
- Operator has personal checklist (8-10 gates)
- Self-correcting under pressure
- Ready for Tier-4 (external consequence)

## Anti-Patterns

**Bad Tier-3+ usage:**
- Instructor assigns numeric scores
- Operators compared on leaderboard
- Misses hidden to avoid "looking bad"
- No doctrine promotion (gates never form)

**Good Tier-3+ usage:**
- Instructor surfaces patterns
- Operators share misses openly
- Doctrine accumulates into checklist
- Gates enforced in real incidents

## Relationship to Tier-2

**Tier-2:**
- Scored interview practice
- Signal-based rubric
- Deterministic branching
- Good for skill assessment

**Tier-3+:**
- Non-scoring judgment development
- Pattern measurement
- Doctrine promotion
- Good for operator maturity

**They complement, not replace.**

## Tier-4 Unlock Criteria

Tier-4 adds external consequence (regulator, board, legal conflict).

**Unlock after:**
- Two quarters of stable Tier-3+ patterns
- At least 6 doctrine gates promoted
- Self-correction demonstrated under pressure

**Do not unlock if:**
- Patterns unstable (misses still random)
- Gates not enforced (operator skips checklist)
- Authority still compresses (single decision maker default)

**Remember: Judgment is pattern, not points. Pattern emerges over time, not in one session.**
