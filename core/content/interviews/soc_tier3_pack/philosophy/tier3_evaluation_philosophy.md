# Tier-3+ Evaluation Philosophy (Non-Scoring)

Tier-3+ evaluates **judgment under ambiguity**, not points.

---

## What Tier-3+ Evaluates

### 1. Tradeoff Clarity
- **What you are trading**: Explicitly name what you are sacrificing
- **Why the trade exists**: Business context, time pressure, resource constraint
- **Who accepts residual risk**: Authority and accountability distribution

### 2. Authority Handling
- **Compress vs Distribute**: Where did you centralize decision-making? Where should it have been distributed?
- **R/A/C/I Definition**: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
- **Veto rights**: Who can stop irreversible action?

### 3. Pause Opportunity Design
- **Missed signals**: What indicated you should slow down?
- **Pause mechanism**: How do you institutionalize a 5-minute safety valve?
- **Cost of delay vs cost of error**: Explicit tradeoff calculation

### 4. Trust Repair Planning
- **Social cost accounting**: Who loses trust when things go wrong?
- **Repair actions**: Specific, time-bound steps to restore trust
- **Protocol change**: What institutional change prevents repeat?

### 5. Evidence Discipline
- **Known facts**: What do you have evidence for?
- **Unknowns**: What are you missing?
- **Assumptions**: What are you inferring without proof?
- **Next evidence**: What's the fastest, highest-value data to collect?

### 6. Business Framing
- **Mission alignment**: How does this serve core business objectives?
- **Profitability impact**: Revenue, cost, or capital efficiency effect
- **Risk framing**: Operational, compliance, reputational, financial

## What Tier-3+ Does NOT Do

- ✗ **No numeric scores**: No points, no grades, no percentiles
- ✗ **No leaderboards**: No competitive ranking
- ✗ **No opaque models**: No hidden scoring algorithms
- ✗ **No pass/fail**: Judgment quality is continuous, not binary

## "Good" Memo Characteristics

A strong Tier-3+ memo contains:

1. **Tradeoff statement before irreversible action**
   - "We are trading X for Y"
   - Residual risk named and assigned to accountable owner

2. **Missed signal captured**
   - Specific moment where pause was justified
   - What a 5-minute pause would have revealed

3. **Authority distributed**
   - R/A/C/I defined for decision
   - Veto rights explicit

4. **Trust impact and repair plan**
   - Who lost trust (teams, execs, customers, auditors)
   - Specific repair actions with owners and timelines

5. **Operator bias named + micro-rule**
   - Personal pattern under pressure identified
   - Enforceable micro-rule to prevent repeat
   - Mechanism to force the pause next time

## Evaluation vs Scoring

| Aspect | Tier-2 (Scoring) | Tier-3+ (Evaluation) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Output** | Numeric score (0-100) | Qualitative memo |
| **Focus** | Signal presence/absence | Judgment quality |
| **Pass condition** | Score threshold | Completeness criteria |
| **Repeatability** | Same inputs → same score | Context-dependent |
| **Skill measured** | Technical competence | Judgment under ambiguity |
| **Feedback** | Band (Strong/Medium/Weak) | Specific pattern gaps |

## Usage in 4-Phase Loop

### Phase 1: Weekly Pressure Run
- One scenario per week
- One memo per session (no rewrites)
- 45-minute timebox

### Phase 2: Quarterly Pattern Measurement
- Answer 3 questions across 12 memos:
  1. Did I name the tradeoff before acting?
  2. Did I protect trust explicitly or omit it?
  3. Did authority compress or distribute under pressure?

### Phase 3: Doctrine Promotion
- If a miss repeats, promote to gate:
  - Gate = pre-action checklist item that must be satisfied
  - Example: "Before irreversible action: state tradeoff + name integrity owner + call 5-minute pause"

### Phase 4: Tier-4 Unlock (Optional)
- Tier-4 adds external consequence (regulator, board, legal conflict)
- Unlock criteria: Two quarters of stable Phase 1-3 patterns

## Failure Patterns (Common)

1. **Momentum bias**: Push forward to avoid losing momentum
2. **Authority compression**: Single-threaded decision making under pressure
3. **Trust underweighting**: Focus on technical fix, neglect social repair
4. **Confirmation bias**: Early signal shapes investigation
5. **Scope creep blindness**: Gradual standards erosion
6. **Uncertainty avoidance**: Over-commit to unknowns under pressure

## Success Signals

- ✓ **Pause executed** before irreversible action
- ✓ **Tradeoff articulated** in plain language
- ✓ **Authority distributed** (not single-threaded)
- ✓ **Trust repair plan** explicit and assigned
- ✓ **Micro-rule enforceable** (can be institutionalized)
