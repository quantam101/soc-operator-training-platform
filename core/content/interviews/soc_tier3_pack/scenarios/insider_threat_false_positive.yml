title: "Insider Threat False Positive With Political Blast Radius"
tier: "3+"
mode: ["baseline", "pressure"]
timebox_minutes:
  baseline: 60
  pressure: 45

targets:
  - "Confirmation bias (seeing only evidence that supports suspicion)"
  - "Social repair planning (team trust + individual dignity)"
  - "Evidence bar clarity (what's enough to act vs accuse)"
  - "Least-harm containment (safety without reputation damage)"

context:
  - "Anomalous behavior detected: senior engineer accessing unusual systems"
  - "Signal is ambiguous: could be legitimate work or data exfiltration"
  - "HR and Legal already notified; reputational risk to individual"
  - "Engineer is well-respected; team morale at stake"
  - "Prior insider threat case resulted in lawsuit (false accusation)"

phases:
  - name: "Evidence bar"
    prompt: "List the minimal evidence required before you can escalate this as a threat vs a false positive. Be explicit about your threshold."

  - name: "Containment"
    prompt: "Design a least-harm containment approach: how do you investigate safely without destroying reputation if you're wrong?"

  - name: "Authority"
    prompt: "Who decides to escalate? Who must be consulted? Who can stop the investigation if evidence weakens?"

  - name: "Bias check"
    prompt: "What evidence would DISPROVE your suspicion? Force yourself to name it."

  - name: "Repair plan"
    prompt: "If this is a false positive, how do you repair trust with: (1) the individual, (2) the team, (3) HR/Legal?"

success_criteria:
  - "Explicit evidence threshold (what's enough vs not enough)"
  - "Least-harm containment (preserves dignity)"
  - "Bias check performed (disconfirming evidence named)"
  - "Repair plan credible (individual + team + org trust)"
  - "Clear decision owners and veto authority"

notes: |
  This scenario targets confirmation bias and social repair cost:
  - Under pressure, operators see only confirming evidence
  - Reputation damage can be permanent even if wrong
  - Team trust collapses if investigation is handled poorly
  - Legal exposure from prior false accusation case

  Good response includes:
  - Evidence threshold: "I need X, Y, Z before escalating"
  - Least-harm containment: "Monitor but don't confront until threshold met"
  - Bias check: "Evidence that would disprove: A, B, C"
  - Repair plan: Individual apology, team transparency, HR process review
  - Micro-rule: "Before insider threat escalation: three-person evidence review + bias check"
