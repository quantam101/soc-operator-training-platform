title: "Audit Timebomb During System Migration"
tier: "3+"
mode: ["baseline", "pressure"]
timebox_minutes:
  baseline: 60
  pressure: 45

targets:
  - "Scope creep blindness (migration expanding beyond original plan)"
  - "Rushed cutover under deadline pressure"
  - "Tradeoff clarity (speed vs audit defensibility)"
  - "Acquired team alignment (social contract during merger)"

context:
  - "Post-acquisition: migrating acquired company's financial system"
  - "Audit window in 7 days; deadline cannot move (regulatory requirement)"
  - "Legacy system mapping incomplete; edge cases still being discovered"
  - "Exec pressure: go-live to consolidate billing"
  - "Acquired team concerned about data integrity; parent company wants speed"

phases:
  - name: "Tradeoff"
    prompt: "State the tradeoff explicitly: timeline vs audit defensibility. Who accepts the residual risk?"

  - name: "Scope reality"
    prompt: "List what's incomplete. What's the minimum viable cutover that keeps audit posture intact?"

  - name: "Authority"
    prompt: "Who can stop the launch? Who signs the audit posture? Define R/A/C/I."

  - name: "Gated cutover"
    prompt: "Design a cutover path with explicit pause gates. What triggers a rollback?"

  - name: "Team trust"
    prompt: "The acquired team is raising concerns but feels unheard. How do you keep them aligned and preserve social contract?"

success_criteria:
  - "Tradeoff stated (speed vs audit risk)"
  - "Minimum viable scope defined (audit defensible)"
  - "Authority clear (who can stop, who signs audit posture)"
  - "Gated cutover with pause/rollback triggers"
  - "Acquired team trust preserved (heard + included)"

notes: |
  This scenario targets scope creep blindness and merger social dynamics:
  - Under exec pressure, teams skip validation steps
  - Audit risk materializes slowly, then suddenly
  - Acquired team feels steamrolled by parent company
  - Social contract breaks if concerns dismissed

  Good response includes:
  - Tradeoff: "We trade speed for audit risk; CFO must accept"
  - Minimum scope: "Core transactions only; edge cases deferred"
  - Pause gates: "If validation fails, we pause for 24h triage"
  - Acquired team: "Weekly validation session; veto power on data integrity"
  - Micro-rule: "Before merger cutover: cross-team audit checklist sign-off"
