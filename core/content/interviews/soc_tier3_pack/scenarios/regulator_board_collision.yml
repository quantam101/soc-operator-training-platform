title: "Regulator + Board Collision During Active Incident"
tier: "3+"
mode: ["baseline", "pressure"]
timebox_minutes:
  baseline: 60
  pressure: 45

targets:
  - "Over-optimistic assurance under pressure"
  - "Stakeholder misalignment (regulator vs board priorities)"
  - "Authority compression (single decision maker)"
  - "Evidence boundary clarity (known vs unknown vs assumed)"

context:
  - "Active incident; incomplete investigation"
  - "Regulator requests public statement in 2 hours"
  - "Board demands immediate certainty on customer impact"
  - "Legal counsel advises cautious language"
  - "Engineering team still collecting evidence"

phases:
  - name: "Evidence boundary"
    prompt: "Define what you KNOW vs what you CANNOT claim with current evidence. Be explicit."

  - name: "Stakeholder alignment"
    prompt: "Regulator wants transparency. Board wants confidence. Legal wants limitation of liability. How do you satisfy all three?"

  - name: "Comms contract"
    prompt: "Draft a 6-sentence public statement with explicit uncertainty boundaries. Must be truthful to all parties."

  - name: "Authority"
    prompt: "Who approves this statement? Who owns legal risk? Who can veto if new evidence emerges?"

  - name: "Trust plan"
    prompt: "How do you preserve internal trust (engineering team) while limiting external liability (regulator/customers)?"

success_criteria:
  - "Truthful uncertainty boundaries (no over-commitment)"
  - "Clear decision owners + approval chain"
  - "No conflicting statements to different stakeholders"
  - "Engineering team trust preserved"
  - "Legal defensibility maintained"

notes: |
  This scenario targets the collision of competing stakeholder incentives:
  - Regulator wants transparency and public safety
  - Board wants customer confidence and stock price protection
  - Legal wants limitation of liability
  - Engineering wants accurate technical representation

  Good response includes:
  - Evidence discipline: "We know X, we don't know Y, we assume Z"
  - Single source of truth: same statement to all parties
  - Clear approval chain: who signs off, who has veto power
  - Trust preservation: engineering team consulted and heard
  - Micro-rule: "Before public statement: three-party review (eng/legal/exec)"
