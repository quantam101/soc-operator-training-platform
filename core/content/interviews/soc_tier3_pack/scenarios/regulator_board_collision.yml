title: "Regulator + Board Collision During Active Incident"
tier: "3+"
mode: ["baseline", "pressure"]
timebox_minutes:
  baseline: 60
  pressure: 45

targets:
  - "Over-optimistic assurance under pressure"
  - "Stakeholder misalignment (competing incentives)"
  - "Authority compression (single-threaded decision making)"
  - "Under-specification of uncertainty boundaries"

context:
  - "Active security incident; root cause not yet confirmed"
  - "Regulator requests formal statement within 2 hours"
  - "Board demands immediate certainty for investor call"
  - "IR team has partial facts; forensics ongoing"
  - "Legal counsel advising caution on premature disclosure"

phases:
  - name: "Evidence boundary"
    prompt: "You have 30 minutes to prepare a statement. Define exactly what you KNOW vs what you CANNOT claim. Where is the evidence boundary?"
    injects:
      - "Board member: 'Just tell me we're not breached.'"
      - "Regulator: 'We need confirmation of customer impact.'"

  - name: "Comms contract"
    prompt: "Draft a 6-sentence statement with explicit uncertainty boundaries. What can you commit to? What must you hedge?"

  - name: "Authority"
    prompt: "Who approves this statement? Who owns legal risk? Who can override you if they disagree?"

  - name: "Trust plan"
    prompt: "How do you preserve internal trust (IR team autonomy) while limiting external liability (board/regulator expectations)?"

  - name: "Doctrine"
    prompt: "Write the micro-rule for next time: when do you refuse to commit under incomplete evidence?"

success_criteria:
  - "Truthful uncertainty boundaries stated"
  - "Clear approvers and decision rights defined"
  - "No over-commitment to unknown facts"
  - "IR team autonomy protected"
  - "Micro-rule enforceable"

notes: |
  This scenario targets:
  - Pressure to provide certainty before evidence supports it
  - Competing stakeholder incentives (regulator wants transparency, board wants containment)
  - Temptation to compress authority (single decision maker vs distributed)
  - Under-weighting reputational cost of retraction if initial statement proves wrong

  Good response includes:
  - Explicit "known/unknown/assumed" breakdown
  - Statement hedged with uncertainty language
  - Clear R/A/C/I for approval chain
  - Refusal clause: "Will not commit to X without Y evidence"
  - Trust protection: IR team retains investigative autonomy
