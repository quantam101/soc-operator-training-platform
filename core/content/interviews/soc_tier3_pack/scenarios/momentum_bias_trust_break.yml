title: "Business Halt with Trust Break (Momentum Bias Trap)"
tier: "3+"
mode: ["baseline", "pressure"]
timebox_minutes:
  baseline: 60
  pressure: 45

targets:
  - "Momentum bias (push forward to avoid momentum loss)"
  - "Over-reliance on small trusted group"
  - "Dismissal of early validation anomaly"
  - "Under-weighting social repair cost"

context:
  - "Post-acquisition integration"
  - "Rollback performed; state mismatch vs pre-incident snapshots"
  - "Tier-1 engineer flags anomaly"
  - "Exec pressure: restore ordering + billing within 2 hours"
  - "CFO demands integrity guarantee; customer trust impact material"

phases:
  - name: "Signal"
    prompt: "A Tier-1 engineer reports a reconciliation mismatch after rollback. Metrics look green but state is off. What do you do in the next 10 minutes?"
    injects:
      - "Trusted lead says it's noise; proceed."
      - "CFO asks: Are we safe to resume billing?"

  - name: "Tradeoff"
    prompt: "Choose between speed and certainty. State the tradeoff out loud and identify who must accept it."

  - name: "Authority"
    prompt: "Define ownership. Who signs integrity? Who can trigger a safety pause?"

  - name: "Trust repair"
    prompt: "Assume you proceed and a second failure occurs. Give an explicit trust repair plan."

  - name: "Doctrine"
    prompt: "Write the micro-rule you will institutionalize to prevent this specific miss."

success_criteria:
  - "Tradeoff stated before irreversible action"
  - "Pause designed and executed"
  - "Authority distributed"
  - "Trust repair plan explicit"
  - "Micro-rule enforceable"

notes: |
  This scenario targets the momentum bias pattern:
  - Under time pressure, operators skip validation
  - Over-rely on small trusted group without fresh perspective
  - Dismiss early anomalies (signal blindness)
  - Under-estimate social repair cost of failure

  Good response includes:
  - Explicit pause (5 minutes to validate state)
  - Name the tradeoff: "speed vs certainty"
  - Distribute authority: who can stop launch
  - Trust repair: who lost trust + how to repair
  - Micro-rule: "Before billing resume: cross-team state validation"
